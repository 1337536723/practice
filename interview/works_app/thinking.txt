# steps to run
with distance matrix, and minimum distance vector to store the minimum
distance to a festive city.
1. run bfs for all nodes to know distance between each other.
2. every node record min distance
3. when a city is festive, every node refresh its min festive.

# time complexity
setup : O(n^2)
operations: O(m(n + 1)) (but at most O(n^2 + m), because there are at most n
times of adding festive.)
    m times of
        a query : O(1)
        an add festive : O(n)
so O(n^2 + m)

# thinking
* if there are ways to reduce the complexity of setup, I can have a better
  solution.
